Featured Post WordPress Plugin
=============

Plugin for featured wordpress posts. This is a cool plugin that makes it easier to mark posts as featured posts (not using specific categories) and simple markup to show theme from your theme file.

Add <?php query_posts($query_string."&featured=yes"); ?> before the post loop starts and manage the featured posts from the post edit list.

Now added widget for listing featured post in sidebar widgets with custom number of post.
